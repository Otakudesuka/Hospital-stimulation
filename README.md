# Hospital-stimulation
It is basically a mini hospital stimulation where a number of patient models are trained to do certain tasks while a certain number of nurses are trained to attend to those patients.
The concept of GOAP(Goal-Oriented Action Planning) is used here.
Here certain goals are assigned to each of the model along with some action states that the model can perform. This all information is stored inthe world state and then A* algorithm is implemented to this formed planner.


It is basically an implementation of artificial intelligence.
